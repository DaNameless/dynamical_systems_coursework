# Dynamical Systems Coursework

## Repository Description
This repository contains my coursework for the **Dynamical Systems** course taught by Professor Mario Cosenza at Yachay Tech University. The coursework includes theoretical explorations, numerical simulations, and analysis of various dynamical systems.

## Course Overview
This course is an introduction to nonlinear dynamical systems and the phenomenon of chaos from the perspective of contemporary Physics. Historical, theoretical and experimental developments are treated. The course teaches the different scenarios for the transitions to chaos, universal properties, and the characterization of chaotic systems. Computational methods constitute an essential part of the course. This is a fundamental course for the formation of physicists, including concepts and techniques that have many interdisciplinary applications. (Taken from original syllabus for the course)
